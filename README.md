# ChallengeDataAnalyticsWithPython
Desafio de programaci√≥n en python. 

Hi! I am Leo :) I've wrote this code/mess.

This is my solution for the Data Analytics Challenge with Python.
You can read the "Challenge Data Analytics con Python.pdf" file to read the tasks.
I have to say thanks to Alkemy people 'cause I've learned a lot by doing this.

What does the code do?
This code automatically queries three sources: museums, public libraries and cinemas. Then it creates a folder for each CSV file. The name and path of folders is also automatized.

How to use it?
Download -and unzip- the project.
Open your terminal/bash/cmd on project folder and type:
    python main.py
And that's it! Easy right? You now can check your folder and see that there are 3 new folders (museums, libraries and cinemas)


Can I see the sources for the CSV files?
Sources are hardcoded in main.py and they are: 
url for museums = 'https://datos.cultura.gob.ar/dataset/37305de4-3cce-4d4b-9d9a-fec3ca61d09f/resource/4207def0-2ff7-41d5-9095-d42ae8207a5d/download/museos_datosabiertos.csv'
url for cinemas = 'https://datos.cultura.gob.ar/dataset/37305de4-3cce-4d4b-9d9a-fec3ca61d09f/resource/392ce1a8-ef11-4776-b280-6f1c7fae16ae/download/cine.csv'
url for libraries = 'https://datos.cultura.gob.ar/dataset/37305de4-3cce-4d4b-9d9a-fec3ca61d09f/resource/01c6c048-dbeb-44e0-8efa-6944f73715d7/download/biblioteca_popular.csv'
